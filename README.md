Description of the Website

The game modes will be Kid, Easy, and Hard. The game is a solo or single-player game, so it is called Solo Hangman Game.
Description of the Website from End-user or Player Perspective
The aim of playing the game is to correctly spell the word based on a clue presented without hanging the virtual “Stick Man”, the letters of the word will be represented by a blank space for each letter. User will guess each letter in the word by selecting a letter from the English alphabet by typing and entry from the keyboard on their device. For each correctly guessed letter in the word, the blank space or spaces corresponding with the letter will be replaced by the letter and use will receive a point receive a point for each time the letter appears. For each incorrectly guessed letter in the word the game will draw the parts of the scene to hang the “Stick Man” by displaying parts of the hanging gallows and body parts of the “Stick Man” in a seven-step process as follows.
1.	Hanging Gallow
2.	Stick Man Head
3.	Stick Man Body
4.	Stick Man First Arm 
5.	Stick Man Second Arm
6.	Stick Man First Leg 
7.	Stick Man Second Leg
The hanging of the “Stick Man” seven-step process gives the user to spell the word with a maximum of seven (7) wrong entries regardless of the length of the word and that’s where the fun comes in. The game is based on the difficulty of words shown by thre levels.
1.	Kid Mode
2.	Easy Mode
3.	Adult Mode
How the game will work is as follows:
1.	User selects a game mode.
2.	User starts a new game and is presented with a word clue and word to guess represent by a blank space for each letter.
3.	User attempts to guess the word letter by letter.
4.	Game continues until the user either guesses all the letters correctly or the “Stick Man” is hung by the seven-step process by guessing incorrect letters, whichever comes first.
